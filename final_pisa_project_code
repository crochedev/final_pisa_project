#Step 1 install the dataset I was to use (found on CRAN)#
```
install.packages("zoolog")

dataFile <- system.file("extdata", "dataValenzuelaLamas2008.csv.gz",
                        package="zoolog")
dataframe1 <- utils::read.csv2(dataFile,
                                na.strings = "",
                                encoding = "UTF-8")
#changed from dataExample to dataframe

View(dataframe1)

#step 2 install relevent packages
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```
#step 2; 
#reduce table into the columns needed and rename it.
```
# Select specific columns by name
#new_df <- dataframe1[, c("Site", "Especie", "Os","Lat", "Epif", "TAQ", "TPQ", 
                         "GL", "BT", "Bp", "GB", "SH", "SB")]

# Print the new data frame
View(new_df)
nrow(new_df)

#rename the 'Especie' column name to 'Species'
new_df <- new_df %>% rename(Species = Especie)
#check it works
View(new_df)
```

#step 3;
#Study aim one - I want to prove that the size(length and breadth measurements)
#of animal bone remains decreased over time (due to domestication). 
```

#step 3.a; select specific bone, section of bone and 2 measurements to take, 
#in ref to publication and results in the table.

# Humerus for cattle, sheep/goat and pig as there are measurements for bredth 
#and width for both of these clearly labeled on Table 2 of the study. 

#step 3.b; create linear regression model of length vs bredth.
#starting with --- aka ovar (as bota aka cattle did not have enough data that 
#could fulfill GL,BT and bota)

new_df_filtered <- new_df %>% filter(Especie == "ovar")
df_filtered <- na.omit(new_df_filtered)
View(new_df_filtered)

new_df_filtered.lm1 <- lm(GL ~ BT, data = df_filtered)

summary(new_df_filtered.lm1)

ggplot(data = new_df_filtered, mapping = aes(x = BT, y = GL)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, aes(colour = "Regression")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = mean(GL), colour = "Average"))


#step 3.c; scatterplot of results (on a timescale). I wanted to put it on a 
#timescale but due to the lack of results that align it is not possible to do so. 

plot(x = new_df_filtered$BT, y = new_df_filtered$GL, 
     main = "Scatterplot of GL vs BT", 
     xlab = "BT", ylab = "GL", pch = 19, col = "blue") 



```
#step 4;
#study aim two - I want to prove that there is a regional difference between 
#animal sizes at the same periods of time. 

#step 4.a; select a time period to test all of the regions against.

#step 4.b; divide regions/sites and take the average bone size for a specific 
#species in step 3.

#step 4.c; create scatterplot of regions/ sites vs bone size. 
```
