# final_pisa_project
My final piece of work for the Pisa R4aRchaeologiest working on an a dataset of animal remains from different periods of time across Northern Italy.

My Aims:
Aims:
	1. I want to prove that the size(length and breadth measurements) of animal bone remains decreased over time (due to domestication). 
	2. I want to prove that there is a regional difference between animal sizes at the same periods of time. 
	3. I want to prove that animal species had an increase in representation (frequency) overtime and across all sites.
	4. I want to investigate the amount of juvenile vs adult bones found in each region.

Analysis: 
Analysis:
	1. Plot animal bone size vs time. 
		a. Length vs width of bone = size
			a. linear regression model
		b. scatterplot on a timeseries. (Identify clustering?)
		c. t-test. Pick time pre hypothesis period and post and pick from those. Same region and time period. (oldest group and youngest group for being statistically significant and prove hypotheses).
	2. Plot regions vs animal bone sizes.
		a. Scatter plot with line of best fit. 
	3. Abundance of bones by place. Relative frequency calculations of different species. Compare all frequency calculations by time and region.
		a. Visualised as a boxplots or histograms (with interquartile ranges). 
		b. Chi-Squared of all animal species. 
	4. Use "Epif" column use s=fused vs ns=unfused to find and compare frequency.
               a. Barplot of percentages.
